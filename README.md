## Optimal Blackjack

Inspired by a group trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, I've decided to explore one of the most popular gambling games - Blackjack. This intuitive game is fairly simple and is considered a classic game of chance with few rules, making it an interesting modeling problem.

Seasoned players claim to have developed a strong strategy for this game based on the current state of the game (value of current hand and the value of revealed card in the dealer's hand). I plan to either develop a new solution to this task or prove the widely accepted policy is best.

My final goal for this project is to leverage my understanding of reinforcement learning to develop a Q-learning agent to empirically model the success rate of any particular action given a particular game state.
